    <h1>4Rs</h1>
    <p>The 4Rs make for a simple yet effective way to help us consider the items we buy, use, and dispose of. When we choose to stop and think about each of the 4Rs, it allows us to consider several important aspects related to our consumption and impactful changes to our behavior. From what we buy to how we can reduce, to what we can reuse, and how we eventually get rid of it.</p>
<h1>Importance of the 4Rs - Why Do We Need To Be More Aware?</h1>
<p>Many of the products we produce cause greenhouse gases, which contribute to global warming. How we needlessly throw things away impacts the oceans and wildlife. A lack of action has led us to where we are today.</p>
<p>If we do not radically transform how, what, and crucially, how much we consume and mitigate the worst of our negative impacts on the planet, we could see global temperatures increase by at least 2 degrees by 21004. In fact, the last eight years have been the warmest on record.</p>
